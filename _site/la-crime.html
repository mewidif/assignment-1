<p>Analysis:</p>
<p>The most frequent crimes in Los Angeles are non-violent, with an exception of assault and battery. As of 2024, crime in Los Angeles, on all fronts, is declining. Interestingly, in 2022, identity theft was the second most frequent crime, with over 22,000 occurrences. Stolen vehicles have remained at the top of the list over all four years, and it saw a slight peak of almost 25,000 occurrences, also in 2022.</p>
